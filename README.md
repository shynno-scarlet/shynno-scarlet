```
Proof of 2 == 1
Let a = b
Multiply with a
a² = ab
Subtract (-b²)
a² - b² = ab - b²
Apply the 3rd Binomial Formula
(a - b)(a + b) = ab - b²
Apply the Distributive Rule
(a - b)(a + b) = (a - b)b
Divide with (a - b)
a + b = b
Replace a with b (Given with a = b in Step 1)
2b = b
Let b = 1
2 == 1 //

According to Float Math 0.1 + 0.2 is equal to 0.30000000000000004
If we take this as given, we can prove (again) that k == k + 1 | k ∈ ℝ holds.
